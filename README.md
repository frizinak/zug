#  Zug

An X11 terminal image viewer like ueberzug.

- high level lib:   go get github.com/frizinak/zug
- lowish level lib: go get github.com/frizinak/zug/x
- an image viewer : go get github.com/frizinak/zug/cmd/zug

## Todo

- [ ] Drop ueberzug, implement our own X11 windows using xcb (see ueberdiy branch for progress)
- [ ] Animated gifs
- [ ] Perhaps a sprite based game engine for laughs

## Why

- [X] Implement inline image previews in github.com/frizinak/homechat
- [ ] Replace opengl viewer in github.com/frizinak/photos
- [X] Replace imv/feh perhaps in my own workflow
